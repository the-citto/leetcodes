# Leetcodes

My [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) exercises.

Most exercises will have more than one implementation,
from brute force / naive to optimized.

All exercises are tested with 100% coverage, and benchmarks for Big O complexity with
[google-benchmark](https://pypi.org/project/google-benchmark/) (with stubs).
